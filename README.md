  <h2>The Beginning</h2>
  <p> For a brown's fan every NFL season is one that starts with hope but quickly turns to the stuff of nightmares. Although this may be hard to believe once upon a time this wasn't true. The beginning of the browns was a story of success and championships. The browns began in 1946 piloted by one of the greatest coaches to grace the Gridiron, Paul Brown. <img  src="https://media.gettyimages.com/photos/football-cleveland-browns-coach-paul-brown-with-john-wooten-on-game-picture-id81446118?s=612x612"> This was  a time of extraordinary success wherein the browns only lost 4 games over 4 seasons. They were extraordinary led by 2 extraordinary men. the first you know is Paul Brown, the second was Otto Graham. Otto Graham was one of th greatest quarterbacks to play the game. The only thing he did was win, in all 10 season of professional football he made the championship game of <span id="every">every</span>. <span id="single">single</span>. <span id="one">one</span >. </p>
  <p>This dynamic duo started their illustrious careers by reeling off 4 straight championships and were the toast of the AAFC, However after 4 seasons the AAFC folded and the browns had to look elsewhere to play. Luckily a little professional league you may know called the NFL. While this was a big step up to an undoubtedly higher level league, the browns still excelled. They went on a run of 6 straight championship appearances and 3 victories. However in 1955 after leading his browns to a 38-14 win in the championship game, Otto Graham Retired. After that, the browns went on to win just one more championship in the next 55 years. Things Just weren't the same. They never would be that way again. The days when the browns stiked fear in the hearts of their opponents are long gone. Thes remain the glory days, the inspiration for numerous browns regimes to look to while attempting yet another rebuild. <p>
